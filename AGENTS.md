Repo-wide instructions for AI coding agents (Codex, ChatGPT, etc.).

## Consent before changing code

When the user asks a question (e.g. “how do I…?”, “why…?”, “is it possible…?”) or explicitly says “no code / just answer”:

- Do not make code changes. Answer with options/tradeoffs only.
- If implementation would help, ask for confirmation first before editing any files.

Only implement changes when the user clearly requests it (e.g. “please implement”, “make the change”, “can you do X in the repo?”).
