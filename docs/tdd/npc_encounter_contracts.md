# NPC encounter data contracts

Core owns immutable `EncounterDefinition` records, stable `NpcId` identities and
`AiTargetPolicy` preferences. They are independent of player input and enemy
score IDs. These contracts are the first delivered slice of the
[rescue implementation plan](../building/npc_rescue_encounters.md); runtime
encounters, NPC actors, authoring and rescue awards are not integrated yet.

An encounter owns separate NPC and enemy placement lists. Member IDs are unique
across both lists and local to the encounter. Coordinates use world units, with
X relative to the owning chunk. Vertical placement reuses `SpawnPlacementMode`.
The entry rectangle uses an inclusive swept-center intersection; it catches
crossing between samples, a stationary point inside, and boundary contact.

Constructors reject malformed identity, duplicate members, non-finite geometry,
capacity violations and invalid point values without relying on assertions.
Incomplete roles are valid drafts. `validateForChunk` requires a complete roster
by default and checks horizontal containment; full capsule/terrain admission is
the responsibility of the runtime placement boundary.

`EncounterLimits` is shared by source and runtime consumers: four encounters per
chunk, four NPCs and eight enemies per encounter, sixteen live encounters and
192 live participants. Points per NPC range from 0 to 100,000, with 250 as the
initial shared default. Missing override differs from explicit zero or an
explicit value equal to the default. Capacity is a first-release admission
budget, not a promise that every maximum-density layout meets performance goals.

Awards use checked addition against 9,007,199,254,740,991, the shared exact integer
ceiling for JavaScript score consumers. Even a deliberately loose six-hour,
240-Hz estimate that replaces all sixteen live encounters every tick yields
33,177,600,000,000 rescue points, below that ceiling. Checked accumulation remains
mandatory for other tick rates/durations and for combining other score rows;
overflow must fail before mutation, never wrap or silently clamp.

The ordinary-combat regression uses an explicit marker roster on the generated
`field_flat` terrain, with no encounter definitions. Its pre-refactor trace covers
785 ticks and Grojib, Hashash and Unoco behavior, including motion, attack
animation, projectiles, resources and terminal state. Derf placement/casting is
covered separately; it does not appear in this trace. The contract probe is also
compiled and executed to verify admission errors survive AOT assertion removal.
